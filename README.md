==============

Purpose:
The African Sustainable Agriculture Project (ASAP) is a non-profit foundation established to empower,enable and promote the creation of sustainable agricultural endeavors. 

Food security is an important economic factor in much of the developing world. Yet, in many countries the agriculture supply chain is far from sustainable. We believe that ultimately the only sustainable form of Agriculture is entrepreneurship, so we seek to establish agricultural based businesses, enable the development of agricultural entrepreneurship, and promote and facilitate education in agricultural practices that will expand African farmers passed subsistence or sub-subsistence farming to a production system that creates sustainable commerce thereby producing jobs, raising their standard of living, and creating opportunity and social benefit (the ability to pay for school, medical expenses, or start other businesses). 

Background:
For many years, millions of dollars have flooded into Africa to help fight the many issues that face many troubled nations; disease, hunger, clean water, etc. with varying degrees of success, but yet so much still remains to be done. The main problems in farming, worldwide, are soil erosion, poor soil fertility, weed control, failure to rotate crops, and lack of access to capital. Our foundation will identify needs in the agriculture value chain and work to provide sustainable solutions.

Approach:
Our approach will vary depending on how progressive the agriculture practices are in a particular region. If farming practices are more primitive, we can employ extension services to help the local farmers learn the techniques they need to improve their current agronomic practices to create value. Extension can range from plant and soil sciences, animal science to biosystems engineering.

There are many techniques that have proven effective in multiple climates, geographies, topographies, and soil types. When required, we can employ these resources so that individual farmers can improve soil fertility, diversify into a wider variety of crops, or become specialized in one or more areas, such as, pork production, poultry for meat and eggs, goats for meat and milk, or tree nurseries making it possible for new business start-ups. See Appendix A for an overview of some of the agronomic practices employed in our extension services.

Current Projects:

Rwandan Feed mill:

In Rwanda there is a need for a modern feed mill to produce high quality feed for livestock and poultry. Poultry is the most efficient converter of feed to meat, but in order to have a sustainable poultry value chain, properly formulated and milled feed is essential. We will purchase land and build a feed mill that will be capable of producing the high quality feed the efficient production of poultry requires. The feed mill will be a Rwandan registered for-profit business.

Rwandan Hatchery:

Once quality feed is available, the next link in the efficient production of poultry is quality chickens. We will seek to establish a commercial hatchery that will efficiently provide high quality chicken for both table egg and broiler production. Like the feed mill, the hatchery will be a for-profit business. 

Rwandan Distribution Business:

The need will then exist to develop a distribution business to efficiently sell and distribute the feed, chickens, and other supplies. We will be involved at some level in the distribution business.

Extension:

It will be very important to provide the expertise in poultry production to the farmers. We will provide the technical assistance needed to efficiently produce the poultry. Also, we will seek to develop the production of the crops in the local market to support the feed milling operation.

Governance:
ASAP will be governed by a Board of Five Directors here in the US that will establish and approve a business charter, develop policy, and develop and approve the annual budget, guidelines, and operational goals. 

Because ASAP will be establishing for-profit businesses in the countries it operates, we will employ people in each country. The Board will establish the appropriate organizational structure for each entity.
